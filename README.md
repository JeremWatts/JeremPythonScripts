A set of useful scripts with descriptions, usage instructions, and example use-cases. More scripts will be added over time.

### ❗ `groupcrop.py`
**Purpose:** 

   Crop all images in the same folder as the script. Overwrites the original files.  

**How to Use:**  
   1. Place `groupcrop.py` in the folder containing your images.  
   2. Edit the crop values directly in the script.  
   3. Run the script:  
      - On Windows: Open the folder, type `cmd` in the address bar, press Enter.  
      - Type `python groupcrop.py` and press Enter.  
**Use-Case Example:** Preparing Blender sprites for Zandronum.

### ❗ `45RGBA.py`
**Purpose:** 

   Recolour all images in the same folder as the script down to 45 colours + transparency. 

**How to Use:**  
   1. Place `45RGBA.py` in the folder containing your images.  
   2. Run the script:  
      - On Windows: Open the folder, type `cmd` in the address bar, press Enter.  
      - Type `python 45RGBA.py` and press Enter.  
**Use-Case Example:** Optimizing art for games.

### ❗ `time.py`
**Purpose:** 

   Display system time. 

**How to Use:**  
   1. Open command prompt, type `taskschd.msc`, press enter.  
   2. Have the script open in a cmd window on startup. I might detail the steps for this here one day. Use an LLM in the mean time.
**Use-Case Example:** You're seethingly sick of windows' explorer.exe and you still want to see the time.
