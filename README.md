I will add more of the scripts I made over time but I need to give these out before I die so I figured I'd make a start.

Individual Scripts, what they do, how to use them & use-case example:

❗  groupcrop.py // crop all images in the same folder this script. overwrites originals.
  💿  place in folder with images, edit groupcrop.py crop values, run script: for windows, type cmd in addressbar and hit enter. then type python groupcrop.py and hit enter.
  🔧  used to prepare blender sprites for Zandronum
